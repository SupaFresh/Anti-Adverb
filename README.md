# AntiAdverb
### â€œI believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs." - Stephen King
Give it a word and It will tell you if it's an adverb. A Great tool for writers!
This program is compatible with Windows. It can't run on OSX or Linux.


This is a remake of my python Anti-Adverb. 
This time I made it in C# because python made it difficult to setup on computers.
It's now just a plain executable. Enjoy!
